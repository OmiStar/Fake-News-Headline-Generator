# Fake News Headline Generator

A fun Python project that generates random **fake news headlines** from different categories like **sports, politics, and funny**.  
It also allows users to:
- Add their **own custom subject** (e.g., a friendâ€™s name).
- Save generated headlines into a **text file** for later use.

This project demonstrates Python basics (randomization, loops, file handling, and user input) while leaving room for **data collection and analysis**.

---

##  Features
-  **Three categories**: Sports, Politics, and Funny.  
-  Add your **own subject** (friends, custom names).  
- Generate as many **headlines** as you like.  
- Save results in a text file (`fake_news_<timestamp>.txt`).  
- Written entirely in **Python 3** (no external libraries required).

##  Technologies Used
- Python (3.10+ recommended for `match-case`)
- Built-in libraries: `random`, `datetime`
